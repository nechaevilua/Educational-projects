## Building the 'rwd.education' site

You can browse the source files used to build the [rwd.education](https://rwd.education) website here.

To build the site I used a little Gulp build script to speed development.

**Note** that a CSS pre-processor step was used so I can nest media queries inside selectors and TypeScript was used for the little bit of JavaScript I needed because I prefer writing ES6 syntax and TypeScript converts it into more widely supported syntax.

I also used the rather lovely [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to make all the favicon images/manifests.

If you are curious and 'don't mind getting your hands dirty', included in the folder should be everything you need to run it up in a local server yourself.

-   You will need to install a recent version of Node (I used 14 if memory serves)
-   You will need to install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) v4 CLI
-   Run <code>[sudo] npm install</code> in Terminal from the 'rwd.education' folder
-   Assuming all installs OK (cross all your digits!), after everything is installed, you should now be able to run 'gulp' from the Terminal and away you go.

Problems? Open an issue, Tweet at me or send me a mail. Happy building!
